In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. This makes Amazon Customer Reviews a rich source of information for academic researchers in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine Learning (ML), amongst others. Accordingly, we are releasing this data to further research in multiple disciplines related to understanding customer product experiences. Specifically, this dataset was constructed to represent a sample of customer evaluations and opinions, variation in the perception of a product across geographical regions, and promotional intent or bias in reviews.\n",

With a 20% coupon the price was $80 (so comparison shop!) It\\&#x27;s easy to use and seems to work well. I agree with other reviewers about the noise level (loud like a tea kettle boiling), but I use this unit in the living room area so sleeping is not an issue. Having the 2 separate water reservoirs to fill is much easier, weight-wise, as I previously had another humidifier which had one large water reservoir and it was very heavy when full. The unit comes apart quite easily for cleaning and since frequent cleaning is recommended (I usually do it 1x per week, not daily) this is a definite plus. Additionally, one only needs to use vinegar to clean the inside reservoir, which is a lot cheaper than having to buy some kind of \\\\\\\\&quot;special\\\\\\\\&quot; cleaning solution. My one complaint is that it doesn\\&#x27;t, but should, have an automatic shut off when both tanks are empty.I have to remember to turn the unit off when I leave the house. My previous humidifiers all had this auto turn off; seems like every humidifier should.&#x27;</td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">       4</td></tr>\n",

I suffer from back pain constantly and find myself waking up in the middle of the night pushing parts of my back and neck on the edges of walls on the corners of doors and sometimes lying down on tennis or racket balls to get pressure on those dang trigger points.  I opted for the body sticks package not knowing what they would do and it was a good thing.  They are like have racket balls on the ends of sticks to beat your muscle spasms and to lie down on them rolling around on your back. It is worth the money.  They use a device similar to this in physical therapy so if you get your doctor to write you a script for it, insurance may very well pay for it like mine did.  Even so, paid or not, buy this sucker.  Buy two, I thought, just in case it breaks and they for some reason stop manufacturing this thing.

I have rheumatoid arthritis that has particularly affected my low back and hips, and it sometimes makes walking difficult.  The problem with using a cane when you have RA is that RA doesn&#x27;t just affect your lower extremities.  My hands, wrists, and shoulders are also affected.  When I tried a normal cane, it was agonizingly painful for my hand and wrist in particular.  That made it not worth using, even though it did help my hip and back.  A friend with similar issues recommended this one, and the difference was amazing.  It is still a bit hard on my hand after awhile, but not to the point that would make it not worth using.  There really is no perfect solution for this circumstance short of a wheelchair, and I&#x27;m nowhere near ready for that yet!  The forearm rest makes it bearable to use this cane, and it does really help me to walk longer distances when I need to!

With a 20% coupon the price was $80 (so comparison shop!) It\\&#x27;s easy to use and seems to work well. I agree with other reviewers about the noise level (loud like a tea kettle boiling), but I use this unit in the living room area so sleeping is not an issue. Having the 2 separate water reservoirs to fill is much easier, weight-wise, as I previously had another humidifier which had one large water reservoir and it was very heavy when full. The unit comes apart quite easily for cleaning and since frequent cleaning is recommended (I usually do it 1x per week, not daily) this is a definite plus. Additionally, one only needs to use vinegar to clean the inside reservoir, which is a lot cheaper than having to buy some kind of \\\\\\\\&quot;special\\\\\\\\&quot; cleaning solution. My one complaint is that it doesn\\&#x27;t, but should, have an automatic shut off when both tanks are empty.I have to remember to turn the unit off when I leave the house. My previous humidifiers all had this auto turn off; seems like every humidifier should.&#x27;</td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">       4</td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">       1</td></tr>\n",

I suffer from back pain constantly and find myself waking up in the middle of the night pushing parts of my back and neck on the edges of walls on the corners of doors and sometimes lying down on tennis or racket balls to get pressure on those dang trigger points.  I opted for the body sticks package not knowing what they would do and it was a good thing.  They are like have racket balls on the ends of sticks to beat your muscle spasms and to lie down on them rolling around on your back. It is worth the money.  They use a device similar to this in physical therapy so if you get your doctor to write you a script for it, insurance may very well pay for it like mine did.  Even so, paid or not, buy this sucker.  Buy two, I thought, just in case it breaks and they for some reason stop manufacturing this thing.  Good stuff.&quot;                                                                                                                                                              </td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">       5</td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">       1</td></tr>\n",

I have rheumatoid arthritis that has particularly affected my low back and hips, and it sometimes makes walking difficult.  The problem with using a cane when you have RA is that RA doesn&#x27;t just affect your lower extremities.  My hands, wrists, and shoulders are also affected.  When I tried a normal cane, it was agonizingly painful for my hand and wrist in particular.  That made it not worth using, even though it did help my hip and back.  A friend with similar issues recommended this one, and the difference was amazing.  It is still a bit hard on my hand after awhile, but not to the point that would make it not worth using.  There really is no perfect solution for this circumstance short of a wheelchair, and I&#x27;m nowhere near ready for that yet!  The forearm rest makes it bearable to use this cane, and it does really help me to walk longer distances when I need to!  It is a great product, and I&#x27;m happy that I purchased it!&quot;                                                                               </td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">       4</td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">       1</td></tr>\n",

With a 20% coupon the price was $80 (so comparison shop!) It\\&#x27;s easy to use and seems to work well. I agree with other reviewers about the noise level (loud like a tea kettle boiling), but I use this unit in the living room area so sleeping is not an issue. Having the 2 separate water reservoirs to fill is much easier, weight-wise, as I previously had another humidifier which had one large water reservoir and it was very heavy when full. The unit comes apart quite easily for cleaning and since frequent cleaning is recommended (I usually do it 1x per week, not daily) this is a definite plus. Additionally, one only needs to use vinegar to clean the inside reservoir, which is a lot cheaper than having to buy some kind of \\\\\\\\&quot;special\\\\\\\\&quot; cleaning solution. My one complaint is that it doesn\\&#x27;t, but should, have an automatic shut off when both tanks are empty.I have to remember to turn the unit off when I leave the house. My previous humidifiers all had this auto turn off; seems like every humidifier should.&#x27;</td><td>4.0              </td><td>1       </td></tr>\n",

I opted for the body sticks package not knowing what they would do and it was a good thing.  They are like have racket balls on the ends of sticks to beat your muscle spasms and to lie down on them rolling around on your back. It is worth the money.  They use a device similar to this in physical therapy so if you get your doctor to write you a script for it, insurance may very well pay for it like mine did.  Even so, paid or not, buy this sucker.  Buy two, I thought, just in case it breaks and they for some reason stop manufacturing this thing.

I have rheumatoid arthritis that has particularly affected my low back and hips, and it sometimes makes walking difficult.  The problem with using a cane when you have RA is that RA doesn&#x27;t just affect your lower extremities.  My hands, wrists, and shoulders are also affected.  When I tried a normal cane, it was agonizingly painful for my hand and wrist in particular.  That made it not worth using, even though it did help my hip and back.  A friend with similar issues recommended this one, and the difference was amazing.  It is still a bit hard on my hand after awhile, but not to the point that would make it not worth using.  There really is no perfect solution for this circumstance short of a wheelchair, and I&#x27;m nowhere near ready for that yet!  The forearm rest makes it bearable to use this cane, and it does really help me to walk longer distances when I need to!
